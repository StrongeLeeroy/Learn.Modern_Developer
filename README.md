# Learn.Modern Developer
###### Study guide progress

This repo contains my solutions to the exercises proposed by the Learn.Modern Developer [Intro To JavaScript and Modern Web Development](https://learn.modern-developer.com/IntroToJavaScript_and_ModernWebDevelopment.pdf) study guide.

I will update the repository as I progress through the guide, and will probably add notes on weeks 1 through 3 as time allows.
